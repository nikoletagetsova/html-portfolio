<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Nikoleta Krashevska and I am an architect.<br />
    My interest in creating appealing and visually engaging presentations of architecture, led me to pursue a practice as a 3D modeler and visualization artist.<br />

    I am looking to further broaden my skills in UX/ UI design, creating not only usable, but also aesthetically pleasing products. I can offer my skills in ZBrush, Substance Painter, Photoshop, animations and my basic knowledge of Unreal Engine and Unity.<br />
    
    If this interests you, I will be more than happy to share my experience with you!
